When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A remote repository is useful to collaborate with others on the same project.
Also you can work on the same projects from different machines. Different people 
can work independently on the same project and collaborate using the remote
repository. Also, if the local machine crashes, your work would be safely 
backed up in the remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If changes were automatically pulled from remote repository, changes made by 
other people might conflict with the work you might have been doing on the same
project. It will become highly confusing and distracting if the code of the project
you are working on keeps on updating automatically from time to time.
Instead, gitHub allows you to pull the changes so that you can work at your own 
pace and collaborate when you are done with your part.
